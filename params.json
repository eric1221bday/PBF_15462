The final result ideally would be similar to the results of the original paper by Macklin et. al. Shown below is their result\r\n\r\n![PBF result](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F5KuP6qEuew/maxresdefault.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n1. Implement Position Based Fluid simulator using algorithm described in [Macklin et. al.](http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf).\r\n2. Implement Marching Cubes Algorithm to generate fluid mesh\r\n2. Implement OpenGL code for real time viewing and interaction\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nEric Fang (@eric1221bday)\r\n",
